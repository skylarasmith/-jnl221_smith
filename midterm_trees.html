			<p>This December, over 1,000 trees will be planted in the Bronx-a 50% increase from last year. While no new plantings are planned for Manhattan or Staten Island in the January 2026 season, Queens can expect over 2,500 new trees. Lokking ahead to June, six tree plantings are scheduled for Manhattan-two on West End Avenue, two on Columbus Avenue, and the rest in nearby areas-spanning across City Council Districts 3, 6, and 7.</p>
