		<p><strong>Data Hypothesis:</strong> Chain restaurants in Syracuse had more non-critical violations than independently owned buisnesses during 2025.<p>

		<p>I think this is a good data hypothesis because I can use the information provided in the <a href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Onondaga-County-Restaurant-Inspections/tbxv-5tbd/about_data/" target="_blank">dataset<a/>regarding the number of restaurants that had non-critical violations to either prove or disprove my claim. This hypothesis raises a question of whether local buisnesses with a smaller staff are paying more attention to meeting regulated expectations more often than bigger corporations; especially post pandemic, when small buisnesses took a hit, I am interested to see the difference in how each establishment performed.
