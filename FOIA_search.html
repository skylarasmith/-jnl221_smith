		<section>
			<p>I am interested in learning more about the Mayor of Syracuse Ben Walsh’s budget strategy over the past eight years he has served in office, and how that has shifted from his original campaign goals. Walsh was elected in 2018, and recently proposed a $348 million spending plan. Four months ago, The City of Syracuse announced spending reductions and program modifications across departments including the police, parks and recreation, public works, and fire after the Common Council reduced the city’s Fiscal Year 2025-2026 budget. The government claims that “all changes are being implemented with careful consideration of the community and public safety requirements,” though I would like to compare the Walsh Administration’s original promises from the beginning of his campaign to what is currently happening. The document provides data regarding specific amounts of money cut from each section, such as the $150,000 taken away from the Mayor’s effort to reduce gun violence.</p>
