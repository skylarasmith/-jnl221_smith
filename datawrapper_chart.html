		<!-- STEP ONE: Add an introduction to your dataviz here, and what story it will be a part of. -->
		<section>
			<p>This dataviz shows the percentage of children in each Syracuse census tract who are not considered kindergarten-ready by the Syracuse City School District. I chose to highlight this data because it reveals the jarring number of children entering school unprepared and how closely these numbers coorelate with the socioeconomic conditions of each tract. This will help me illustrate the relation between a student's race/ethnicity, financial state, and academic readiness.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP TWO: Add the photo of your sketched chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual photo to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->

		<!-- STEP THREE: Add the screenshot of your first Datawrapper chart here. Don't forget to upload the actual screenshot to your Github repo so that it shows up on your webpage. -->
		<img src="photo2.png" alt="Map of Syracuse" height="300px" width="auto">

		<!-- STEP FOUR: Add the feedback you got from your partner here. -->
		<section>
			<p>My partner gave me very helpful feedback, and noted that it is important for me to include the data of each census tract in the city in order to make a fair analysis. He suggested I change the color palette, as the shades blended together, and explore some more of my findings. He also said that I could add more information to the footnotes. I was struggling to put my data into this map format, but over the weekend, I was able to figure it out, and was able to revise my dataviz.</p>
		</section>

		<!-- STEP FIVE: Add the iframe for your updated chart here. Replace the entire iframe below, from <iframe... to </script> -->
		<iframe title="In most Syracuse neighborhoods, more than half of children are considered not kindergarten-ready" aria-label="Choropleth map" id="datawrapper-chart-cviSY" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cviSY/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="883" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script>

		<!-- STEP SIX: Explain what you changed on your chart here, and why. -->
		<section>
			<p>My updated dataviz now has the information of every census tract in the city besides two of them because of the limited data provided. I changed the color scheme to blue which has more variety, and solidified a strong finding. I also matched up the data of each census tract to where it would appear to be on the map physically, not through datawrapper, so it was accurate. I think this dataviz displays my data analysis in the clearest and most organized format.</p>
