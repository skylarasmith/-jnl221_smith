			<p><a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/" target="_blank"> This is the link to my first data set.<a/>
	<p><ol>
		<li><strong>First data set:</strong> This data set showcases the most popular government web pages and the 4,000 federal websites accounted for by the U.S. Digital Analytics Program (DAP). The data set includes app analytics that accounts for the number of active users, first-time users, total views and files downloaded by collecting the amount of users who visited them in the past 30 minutes. It organizes the data by cities, countries, and languages, and provides it’s traffic sources. In addition, it includes the user’s device demographics and top downloads. The data is portrayed through percentages and bar graphs.<p></li> 

	<p><li>This data is newsworthy because it reveals how people are interacting with government pages and therefore what topics they care about. If certain pages are heavily trafficked, it can indicate what improvements, if any, are needed. It also indicates what the government is delivering, or not. If there are steady spikes in the number of visits on the website, it could also provide context for emerging issues, such as public health concerns or natural disasters. Specifically, a good audience for a story on this would be the users of a top-used website, which currently is USPS.com, and on if President Trump’s imposed tariffs are impacting their experience. More generally, this topic may be intriguing to the public and reveal common interests.<p></li>

	<p><li>Users from Miami, Florida contributed the most to a spike in usage of the National Weather Service’s website during the 2024 Hurricane Season.<p></li>

	<p><a href="https://overthecap.com/" target="_blank"> This is the link to my second data set. <a> 
	<p><li><strong>Second data set:</strong> This data from “Over The Cap” is gathered from the contracts of players in the NFL, including their salaries, bonuses, and contract duration. It shows the top contracts, organized by teams and the player’s position on the field, and their average earnings per year. It also shows the 2025 cap space, which is how much salary cap room a team has, and free agent spending. There are interactive tools, such as a calculator, tables, and historical data, like previous career earnings. It is collected through media reports, press releases, and estimates.<p></li>

	<p><li>This data is newsworthy because sports players, fans, and analysts deserve to know how the NFL is spending money, how contracts are structured, and how that may differ between teams. It shows the how the amount of cap space a team has affects their ability to sign agents and players. It may also highlight unfair and unequal pay discrepancies between different players because of bias or inflation. The NFL season is currently in action, so the story would be relevant and engage an audience of sports journalists, the fantasy football community, and economists.<p></li>

	<p><li>Quarterbacks, running backs, and linebackers from teams that made it farther in the playoffs have a higher average per year than players on teams that did not make it to the playoffs.</p></li>
